One of the fundamental tools for time management is that list of things you need to get done.
It consolidates all your tasks in one place. 
From there you can prioritize them and tackle the important ones first.
There are 5 key advantages to maintaining a to-do list:
Having a written list helps us remember when things have to be done so we do not miss anything.
A to-do list lets you coordinate similar tasks
A to-do list helps us to avoid repetition of labour.
For example, if we have to deliver a document at an office and collect a document from another office which is on the same block, both these tasks can be done together.
A to-do list tracks your progress
Using a to-do list enables you to mark off the tasks you have completed. At the end of the day, when you look at the list, it will give you a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. It might also have the effect of waking you up if nothing has been marked completed.
